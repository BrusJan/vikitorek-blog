# Introducing Vikitorek: Making Knowledge Accessible for Kids

I'm thrilled to announce the official launch of **Vikitorek** - a kid-friendly Wikipedia assistant designed to transform complex information into easily digestible content for young minds. Vikitorek will be available worldwide on **May 9th, 2025**.

## What is Vikitorek?

Vikitorek is an educational Web App that uses AI to simplify Wikipedia articles into language that children can understand. Whether it's dinosaurs, space exploration, or historical events, Vikitorek breaks down complex topics into fun, age-appropriate explanations.

## Key Features

‚ú® **Child-Friendly Explanations** - Complex Wikipedia articles transformed into content a 6-year-old can understand

üåç **Multilingual Support** - Available in 7 languages (Czech, English, German, French, Italian, Polish, and Spanish)

üÜì **Free Tier Available** - Try before subscribing with 10 free searches

## Why I Built Vikitorek

As a parent and developer, I noticed the gap between children's curiosity and the accessibility of information online. Wikipedia is an incredible resource, but its content is rarely written with young readers in mind.

Vikitorek bridges this gap, enabling children to explore any topic they're curious about in language they can understand, fostering a love for learning from an early age.

## Unlimited Tier disabled for the moment

At this moment, we have decided to postpone the launch of unlimited tier (more info here: [blog.vikitorek.com - Unlimited disabled](https://blog.vikitorek.com/blog/unlimited-disabled/))

## Try It Today!

Visit [vikitorek.com](https://vikitorek.com) to start exploring the world of knowledge with your children.

Vikitorek was built as a solo project using Angular, Node.js, Firebase, and Mistral AI.
