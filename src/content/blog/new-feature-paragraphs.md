# Take Control of Your AI-Generated Content Length

We're excited to announce a new feature that gives you precise control over the length of AI-generated responses in Vikitorek. Based on user feedback requesting more flexibility in content generation, we've added a **paragraph count selector** that lets you specify exactly how many paragraphs you want in your AI responses.

## What's New?

The new input field allows you to set the number of paragraphs for AI-generated text, ranging from concise single-paragraph responses to comprehensive multi-paragraph content. This feature is perfect for users who need specific content lengths for different use cases.

### Key Benefits:

- **Precise Control**: Set anywhere from 1 to 10 paragraphs for your generated content
- **Consistent Output**: Get predictable content length that matches your requirements

## How It Works

Using the new paragraph selector is simple:

1. Look for the new "Paragraphs" input field
2. Enter your desired number of paragraphs (1-10)
4. Generate your content as usual (by pressing search or using example)

The AI will now respect your paragraph count preference and structure the response accordingly.

## Why We Added This Feature

Our users from Italy told us they needed more control over content length which was an easy to implement feature that we have planned with lower priority.
