### 🚀 We launched on Product Hunt!

June 27th, 2025 was a big day for Vikitorek — we officially launched on Product Hunt, and the response has been incredible!

### 📊 The results

Here's how our Product Hunt launch went:
- **#16 Product of the Day**
- **114+ upvotes** in the first 24 hours
- **20+ new user registrations** on launch day
- **14+ comments and 2 five-star reviews** from the Product Hunt community
- **120 launch points**

We also received several emails offering collaboration in areas like marketing, security, and more.

One particularly heartwarming message came from an Italian company that successfully embedded Vikitorek.com into their educational tool for children with disabilities. I personally hope this partnership will grow and that Vikitorek can help even more teachers and students in Italy.

On top of that, I received several LinkedIn connection requests — a few of them from actual investors. I'm excited to explore what that might lead to!

### 🎯 What’s missing

While the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, we haven’t received many feature requests, user ideas, or bug reports. If you have thoughts on how to improve Vikitorek, don’t hesitate to reach out — we’re actively monitoring our inbox at **info@vikitorek.com**.

### 🙏 Thank you!

A huge thank you to everyone who supported our launch:
- The Product Hunt community for the warm reception
- Our existing users who shared and voted
- Fellow makers who offered advice and encouragement
- Everyone who tried Vikitorek for the first time

Your support means everything!

### 🔜 What's next

We have exciting ideas in the pipeline — things like a newsletter, short quizzes based on topics, and referral features to unlock more queries. However, these plans aren’t fully validated yet.

Our immediate focus is on **talking to users** and understanding how Vikitorek fits into their daily routines so we can shape the next set of features around real needs.
