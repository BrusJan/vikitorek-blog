### 💡 Unlimited tier has been temporarily disabled
At this moment, users can only use free tier.

We understand that some users would love to use Vikitorek more extensively. However, we have not enabled the unlimited tier yet for two key reasons:
Beta Stability – The app is still being tested, and we’re fine-tuning its performance. Enabling unlimited access too early might cause downtime or interruptions.
Free Infrastructure Limits – Vikitorek currently runs on the free tiers of the Mistral API and Render.com, which means our backend and language model capacity are limited.

We want to make sure everything runs smoothly before opening the gates to heavier usage.

### 🆓 Free Tier = 10 Queries
Right now, Vikitorek is in beta and available on a free tier, which allows each registered user to enter up to 10 queries.

We want to keep the app reliable and sustainable while we test its functionality and gather feedback.

### 🛠️ What’s Next?
We’re working on:

- Improving reliability
- Preparing for paid infrastructure
- Unlimited subscription tier for power users (for 9$ monthly)

### Planned features
- Reporting incorrect answers
- Making sure to answer correctly even when Wikipedia does not have an answer

**Thanks for trying out Vikitorek during this early stage! We appreciate your patience as we continue building it out.**
