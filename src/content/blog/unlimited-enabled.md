### ðŸŽ‰ Unlimited tier is back!

We're excited to announce that the unlimited tier for Vikitorek.com is now enabled again! After a temporary pause, we've successfully resolved our hosting issues and are ready to offer unlimited access to Vikitorek query engine.

### ðŸ’ª What we improved

During this period, our team has been hard at work:
- Upgrading our server infrastructure
- Switching AI model to openrouter Gemma 3 (with backups)
- Switching backend hosting to zerops therefore enhancing overall system stability and availability

These improvements have not only made Vikitorek more reliable but also more cost-efficient to operate.

### ðŸ’° Permanent 50% discount

Thanks to our optimized hosting solution, we're thrilled to announce that we can now offer the unlimited tier at **half the originally planned price**. Instead of $9 monthly, you can enjoy unlimited Wikipedia summaries for just **$4.50 per month, forever!**

This isn't a temporary promotion â€” it's our new standard pricing, making Vikitorek's unlimited tier more accessible to everyone who wants to explore Wikipedia content through kid-friendly summaries.

### âœ¨ Reminder - what even is unlimited tier?

With the unlimited tier, you get:
- Unlimited Wikipedia article summaries
Free tier allows only 10 queries for users to decide whether Vikitorek is worth the one coffee per month

### ðŸ”œ Coming soon

We're still working on the planned features mentioned previously:
- Reporting incorrect answers
- Improved responses when Wikipedia lacks information
- Additional language support (coming in Q4)

### How to upgrade

To upgrade to the unlimited tier, simply:
1. Log in to your Vikitorek account
2. Go to Profile (button at top right)
3. Click "Activate subscription"

**Thank you for your patience and support during this transition.**
