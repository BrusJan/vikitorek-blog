	<p>
		I'm a guy in my forties from Czechia who loves coding and cherishes his family. I have a wonderful wife and four amazing daughters.

    Balancing side coding projects with a full-time job and family life is no easy featâ€”but from what people tell me, I'm managing pretty well. ðŸ˜‰

    I've always been a creative person. I play the piano, and I recently picked up the violin to stay in tuneâ€”literallyâ€”with one of my daughters.
